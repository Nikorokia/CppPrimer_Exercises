# Exercise 1.6
_Explain whether the following program fragment is legal._

``` c++
std::cout << " The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1+v2 << std::endl;
```
This fragment is not legal, because the `;` after `v1` and `v2` ends the statement, removing the operand from the `<<` on the next line.  
Simply removing the `;` from the first two lines is enough to fix the problem.

When tested on `ex01.04.cpp`, compiling produced the following error:
``` bash
$ g++ ex01.04.cpp && ./a.out
ex01.04.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
ex01.04.cpp:8:15: error: expected primary-expression before ‘<<’ token
               << " is " << v1 * v2 << std::endl;
               ^~
```
