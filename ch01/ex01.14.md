_Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those_  
_using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?_  

**While loops** are better in instances when there may need to be multiple instances of the same iteration, ie. visiting the same value multiple times. While loops also perform better when there are sufficient other means of tracking and changing the iterations.

**For loops** are better when there will only be one instance of each iteration, ie. only visiting a value once. For loops also excel in bringing there own iteration tracking variable to the table.
