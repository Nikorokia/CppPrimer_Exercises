_Exercise 2.5: Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain_  
_the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:_  

1. **'a', L'a', "a", L"a"**  
    `char`, `wchar_t`, `string` array of `char`, `string` array of `wchar_t`  

2. **10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC**  
    `int`, unsigned `int`, unsigned `long` integer, octal `int`,  hexadecimal `int`  

3. **3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L** 
    `double`, single-precision `float`, `long` `double`  

4. **10, 10u, 10., 10e-2**  
    `int`, unsigned `int`, `double`, `double`  

_Exercise 2.6: What, if any, are the differences between the following_  
_definitions:_  
`int month = 9, day = 7;`  
`int month = 09, day = 07;`  
- The first line is of valid decimal `int`s, the second line is illgal: `09` isn't a valid octal definition.  

_Exercise 2.7: What values do these literals represent? What type does each_  
_have?_  
1. **"Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"**  
    `string`, with 'f' and 'LF' (Line Feed) written as escape characters (assuming ASCII).  

2. **3.14e1L**  
    `long` `double` with a value of 31.4.  

3. **1024f**  
    `float` with a value of 1024.0.  

4. **3.14L**  
    `long` `double` with a value of 3.14.
