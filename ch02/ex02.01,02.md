The biggest difference in int, long, long long, and short is length of available memory allocation.  
The difference in unsigned and signed is the availability of a negative value.  
The difference between a float and a double is the amount of precision in calculating the fraction.

Rates contain decimals but don't usually contain many significant digits, so it could be stored as a double or even a float.  
Mortgage principals tend to be large; if a 10-digit double (99,999,999.99) isn't enough, the number could be stored as integers representing different parts of the decimal.  
Payments should be similar to principle, allowing for the entire principle to be paid off at once.
