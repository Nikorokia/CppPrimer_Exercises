### Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:
```
int a = 3, b = 4; 
decltype(a) c = a; 
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
```

`a` (`int`) = 3, `b` (`int`) = 4, `c` (`int`) = 4.  
`d` (int ref, `int&`, bound to `a`) = 3.  


### Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:
```
int a = 3, b = 4; 
decltype(a) c = a; 
decltype(a = b) d = a;
```

`a` (`int`) = 3, `b` (`int`) = 4, `c` (`int`) = 4.  
`d` (`int&`, bound to `a`) = 3.


### Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.

`auto` deduces the type from the result of a given expression.  
`decltype` deduces the type from the result of a potentially-unrelated expression; or, the result is immaterial, only the type matters.  

Given `int i = 2, j = 3;`,  
`auto a = i + j;` will give `a` type `int` and a value of 5.  
`decltype(i+j) b = 0;` will give `b` type `int`, but a value of 0.  

Given `int i = 7, &r = i;`,  
`auto a = r;` will give `a` type `int` and the value from `i`, which is 7.  
`decltype(r) b = i;` will give `b` type `int&`, allowing it to bind to variable `i` which also has a value of 7.
