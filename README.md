# C++ Primer Examples
My creations while reading through the book, _C++ Primer, 5th Edition (2012)_.

I embarked on this journey primarily to learn **C++**, but with the added benefit of forcing myself to work through critical thinking challenges.  

## Quick Reference Notes

Compiling code on Unix:
```
$ g++ -o prog1 prog1.cpp
```
`-o prog1` is the output file.

Compiling code with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 compiler:
```
[dir]> cl /EHsc prog1.cpp
```
`/EHsc` turns on standard exception handling.
